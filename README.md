# JavaGUIPayrollSystem

A Retail Payroll System which has a User Interface which is Password Protected and designed especially for Payroll Employees who are privy to Personal / Financial Details of other employees.

The GUI will allow relevant Employee Details to be entered in Textfields, Hours Worked, and Salary etc. and with this information gathered there are a number of Methods working that will calculate the Wages and Register other Information. There are 3 Separate User Interfaces, Managers, Sales Persons & Cashiers all requesting Specific information unique to the type of Employee. Each GUI has a Class Associated with it where all Calculations & Methods are written. 

The GUI itself completes a number of procedures, which involve creating Objects of Classes, Getting & setting data to and from TextFields and Writing the Entered information to a Specific Out file Folder. I have also included a Read from Out file Button Option on each Employee Type GUI, which once written, allows for data to be fetched from the Out file and read into a separate Frame, without having to lookup the file name.
